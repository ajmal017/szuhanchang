                <p><em>Background</em><br />Since I used to work at Lime Brokerage, a high volume, high throughput brokerage whose clients were all professional black box algorithmic traders, I really got into automated trading myself. Unfortunately, company policy prevented employees from doing any automated trading but I used my time there to learn a lot about the financial markets.</p>
                <p>After leaving Lime, I found some likeminded people including previous coworkers who had also left the company and we started a project to develop and backtest trading strategies. Originally we were going to use off-the-shelf software like Amibroker or WealthLab but quickly determined that these solutions were insufficient to do any serious, minimal latency, high volume day trading, so we decided to write our own backtesting framework.</p>
                <p><em>Technology</em><br />The backtesting trading framework is written in Java. <a href="https://jdic.dev.java.net/">JDIC (Java Desktop Integration Components)</a> and Swing provide a GUI for visual analysis of historic strategy performance. <a href="http://www.junit.org">JUnit</a> serves as the unit testing framework. <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org">Subversion</a> is our source control and it is coupled with <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org">Jenkins</a> (previously Hudson) for continuous integration. A post commit hook was created so we get email alerts whenever a build is broken or fixed. Forward testing of strategies is done through a PaperTrading account at <a href="http://www.interactivebrokers.com">Interactive Brokers</a> through their Trader Workstation (TWS) Java API using custom wrapper classes. Bug tracking is done via RedMine.</p>
                <p><em>Methodology</em><br />Our team of six is geographically distributed throughout Boston, San Francisco, and Shanghai. We collaborate mostly through email because it is asynchronous but hold Skype conferences to brainstorm and make important group decisions. Otherwise, work is done remotely on our own time schedules, since different people may have different busy periods. Every team member has various specialties (mine are system administration, strategy development, and Interactive Brokers API integration) but anyone can work on any part of the system.</p>
                <p>We share information about infrastructure, including logins and such using <a href="http://www.dokuwiki.org">DokuWiki</a>. Decisions are made by prototyping instead of debating; whoever has the best prototype moves forward with their design, and consensus is always reached quickly as a result of the quality of the prototype. We are agile and loosely coupled, so nobody needs to wait on another's progress to continue forward. There are legal structures in place to prevent any IP problems, but as a result I am unable to share further details regarding this project, especially code.</p>

				<p><em>Technology</em><br />Plethura is built using the <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com">Django</a> web application development framework because of its modularity and loosely coupled design.

Unfortunately my business partner has been going through a difficult time with some personal issues, including domestic violence and alcoholism so development has been postponed indefinitely while she deals with these issues. As a result the site is unfinished as you can see, and still only running on a staging server. The project has been abandoned and is now open sourced on GitHub: <br />

				<p><em>Background</em><br />The Ultimate Guide to Programming Interviews was created when I began my job hunt after college. In preparation for the technical interviews commonly given for software developer positions, I collected many of the practice questions that I came across while reviewing. I also included my own coded answers and detailed written explanations for the solutions. Friends asked for the document which I originally kept in a Word file, but it got old emailing them updated versions so I decided to just put all the content on a website.</p>

				<p>According to Google Analytics, the Ultimate Guide to Programming Interviews consistently gets over 6000+ unique visitors per month. Every single visitor is acquired organically - I do no advertising of any sort, including word of mouth. The site is ranked #1 or #2 for the keywords "programming interview" and "programming interviews" and has a Google PageRank of 5.</p>

				<p><em>Technology</em><br />The site was developed using <a href="http://www.drupal.org">Drupal</a>. All interview answers, both code and explanations, were written by myself with the exception of errata credits given on the Contribute page.</p>

				<p><em>Background</em><br />Snowboards for Women was created because I love snowboarding and wanted my to help my then girlfriend choose a snowboard so she could come with me on trips. It was difficult to find a women's snowboard so I used <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/">Beautiful Soup</a>, a Python HTML parser, to scrape the outdoor retailer websites for women's boards. I later found out that each merchant had datafeeds with affiliate links so I switched to that, created a website, and after learning and implementing SEO the site makes me a healthy amount of passive income every winter.</p>
				<p><em>Technology</em><br />Originally the site was just a list of women's snowboards and their links scraped using Beautiful Soup and some regular expressions for personal use. I've since grown it to be a CodeIgniter web application with bash scripts that fetch datafeeds and parse them automatically to keep prices current via cron jobs. </p>
<p>There is also email marketing integration through <a href="http://www.mailchimp.com">Mailchimp</a>, with a custom written <a href="http://www.snowboardsforwomen.com/recommend">snowboard recommendation engine</a> that evaluates a user's snowboarding preferences and automatically sends a delayed email containing recommendations suitable for their style and body shape.

			<div class="column grid_5_5">
				<p><em>Background</em><br />Since the Snowboards for Women business model was so successful, I wanted to duplicate it in other markets as well. As a results, I completely rewrote the framework to build Trekking Poles Guide, which does not have the seasonal problem that Snowboards For Women suffers from. This framework is modular enough to be used for virtually any price comparison / review aggregation site, and I plan on using this framework to build a new outdoor gear review site every month.</p>
				<p><em>Technology</em><br />Everything has been refactored to be clean and reusable, with necessary abstractions to make it easy to generate a new product site using the framework without excessive premature optimization. The code is stored in a private Mercurial repository on <a href="http://www.bitbucket.org">Bitbucket</a>. All of the tedious tasks such as downloading and parsing data feeds to obtain up to date prices have been automated using shell scripts run via cronjobs, so after building a site the technology portion will be pretty much hands off so I can focus on customer service and marketing.</p>

				<p><em>Technology</em><br />The site was made in <a href="http://www.codeigniter.com">CodeIgniter</a>, a rapid development PHP MVC framework. All the HTML/CSS was done by hand; no templating system was used. MySQL was the database used via CodeIgniter's ActiveRecord class. We had a Subversion repository from the start to help with collaboration.</p>
				<p><em>Methodology</em><br />We were a very democratic group; all decisions made had to be unanimous, but unfortunately we found out that this meant that decisions took a long time to come to a conclusion. After they graduated, my cofounders and I continued work on the site remotely with weekly status meetings. Approximately half of the site was created in this fashion. We decided to call it quits about a year later after it was clear that our venture capital backed competitor <a href="http://www.glassdoor.com" rel="nofollow">Glassdoor</a> had dominated the market.</p>
